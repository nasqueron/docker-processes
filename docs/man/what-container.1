.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility searches the standard input for lines containing a PID from a processus belonging to a container.
.Pp
When a known PID can be found, it adds the relevant container name to the line.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
prints the container name before the line, on a 20 spaces column. When no container has been found,
it left the space blank.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl -append
Append the container name to the line, instead of prepend it.
.It Fl w Ar width
Determine the width (in characters) of the container column. By default, a 20 characters width column is used.
This option is ignored in append mode.
.It Fl p Ar position
Force the use of the specified column to lookup the PID. If omitted, PID is searched in the two first columns.
Position starts at 1 for the first column, like in awk.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Ev LANG , LC_ALL
and
.Ev LC_CTYPE
environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm
as described in
.Xr environ 7 .
.Pp
If UTF-8 encoding is detected, and a container name must be truncated, it outputs three dots (â€¦).
When undetected, it fallbacks to output a plus (+).
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
